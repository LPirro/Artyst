## Layer Architecture
This app is based on MVVM architecture and follows Clean Architecture principles with the repository pattern

## Modularisaton
![Artyst Modules](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3328096/218133900-ebf32ce6-5571-4fc5-a887-814c3eec9d19.png)

- **app**: Is the entrypoint of the application. It contains the main navigation graph, the app icon and the MainActivity for the Single-Activity pattern.
- **core**: Is shared with all the modules and contains shared logic, util classes, extension functions and shared UI components (in a larger project I would consider moving all the UI shared views into a dedicated `:design` module)
- **data**: All the data-related logic belongs to this module. It contains the Network implementation and the Repositories implementations from the `:domain` module.
- **domain**: Contains all the business logic, the repositories interfaces and the use-cases
- **feature**: Is the presentation layer and contains all the features of the app like Search and Artist Detail.

## Design
For designing this app, I used Figma. You can find the artboards of the project on the [following link](https://www.figma.com/file/fbm1V854CeRgjG3AT5oybW/Artyst?node-id=1%3A35&t=C9cJNQDI3zEDU9dV-1)

## Areas of improvements
There are areas where the project can be improved.
- Pagination on Search feature
- UI Test coverage
- Hardcoded strings in some mappers
